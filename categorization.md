### Design patterns are split into 3 categories:
- **Creational Patterns.** 
  - They deal with the creation (construction) of objects.
  - Explicit (Constructor) vs. Implicit (DI, reflection, etc.). DI - dependency injection framework, reflection mechanism etc., which create an object behind the scenes. It's not an explicit creation in sense that you don't call a constructor to initialize sth.
  - Whole-sale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step). There're different processes to initialize objects before they're ready to use.
    
- **Structural Patterns.**
  - Concerned with the structure (e.g. class members)
  - Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface.
  - Stress the importance of a good API design. Trying to replicate the interface or make it as convenient to use as possible.
    
- **Behavioral Patterns.**
  - They are all different; no central theme
