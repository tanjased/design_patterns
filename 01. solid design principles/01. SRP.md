Single Responsibility Principle. (Separation of Concern)

If you have a class, the class should have its primary responsibility and shouldn't take other secondary responsibilities.
For example, it's better to keep save/load responsibilities in a separate class, not inside a specific one, because this functionality might be used/changed by different classes and there will be no need to go to each class and change it inside it.  

A class should have only one reason to change.

_Separation of concerns_ - different classes handling different independent tasks/problems.

Notes:

`@staticmethod`
