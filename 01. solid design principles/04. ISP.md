INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE

You don't want to stick too many elements into your interface.

We create a class with a set of functions.
New inherit classes will contain all these functions, but we might not need them in this specific class, even to be visualized (to avoid confusion).
So we don't want our new inherit classes be able to call some functions (as there's no implementation for them in this class).
One of these options (besides `pass`) would be `raise NotImplementedError("Printer cannot scan or sth!")`. But it's not a good idea.

So instead of having one large interface with several options/members in it, you will split the interface into several parts, and you'll be able to call it when needed (you'll create new classes with the corresponding method, and new inherit classes).
Decorating with `@abstractmethod`.
