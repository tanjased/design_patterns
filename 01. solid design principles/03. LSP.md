LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE

If you have an interface which takes a base class, you should be able to stick a derived class in there and everything should work.

We make a derived class which inherits from the parent class.
From the example. As a result we have a function which works only with the parent class and doesn't work on any derived classes.

This is a direct violation of Liskov Substitution Principle. To fix you might not even need a separate child classes with decorators setters, it might be better to have a boolean property on the parent class (e.g. telling you if it's a square or not), or you might have _a factory method_ which turns the rectangle to a square, or others.
