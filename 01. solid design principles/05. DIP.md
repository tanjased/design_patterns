DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE

High-level classes/modules should not depend directly on low-level classes/modules in your code, instead they should depend on abstractions.
Abstract class or abstract class with abstract methods. So you just want to depend on interfaces rather than on concrete implementations, because that way you can swap one for another.
Python uses **duck-typing**, stick in a different class with the same interface.

Variables in a method should not be dependent on internal variables of other methods.

So it should not depend on a concrete implementation, but on an abstraction that can be subsequently changed.



NOTES:
- abstract classes
- duck-typing
