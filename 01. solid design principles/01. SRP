Single Responsibility Principle. (Separation of Concern)

If you have a class, the class should have its primary responsibility and shouldn't take other secondary responsibilities.
For example, it's better to keep save/load responsibilities in a separate class, not inside a specific one, because this functionality might be used/changed by different classes.
