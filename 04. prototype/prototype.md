- Complicated objects are almost never designed from scratch (cars, houses). You reiterate through existing designs, what already has been done, and you try to improve it
- An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a **Prototype**
- So we make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it. _Deep copy_
- We make cloning convenient (e.g. by implementing a _Factory_)


**PROTOTYPE** is a partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of it.
